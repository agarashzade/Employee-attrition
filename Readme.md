The project aims to analyze Employee attrition data prepared by IBM to gain insights on the effects of wide range of employee attributes (department, education, job role, job satisfaction, monthly income, etc.) on employee attrition. First, I will clean and analyze the data in Python. Then, with the cleaned data, I am planning to create dashboards summarizing the main insights from my analysis in PowerBI.
